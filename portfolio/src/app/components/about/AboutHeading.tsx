          Hello! My name is <strong className="text-color-bright">Dylan</strong>{" "}
          and I have always loved tackling creative and technical challenges, especially 
          when problem solving is involved.

          My interest in programming began in the 8th grade. That summer, I set out to learn what is involved
          in making a game. In doing so I discovered C++ tutorials. This led me to spending countless nights 
          coding, often until 2am. I loved every second of it, even if I was exhausted in the morning before school.
