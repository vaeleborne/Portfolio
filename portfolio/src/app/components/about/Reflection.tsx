            From the beginning of my journey to this very day, one thing has remained consistent:
            my love of learning new technologies and deepening my expertise in the ones I use daily.

            This portfolio itself is practice. Originally built as an express app, it is now converted 
            to be using 
            <span className="text-color-bright"> HTML5, CSS, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Bootstrap. </span>
            It is a reflection of my commitment to constant growth as a developer.
