                <p>
                    Hello! My name is <b class="highlight" >Dylan</b> and I enjoy working on all sorts of creative projects...especially when problem solving is needed!
                    My desire to learn programming dates back to the 8th grade; Fascinated and intrigued by countless video games I wanted to learn more of what made them tick.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was that summer, before starting school, that I decided to research different aspects of 
                    making my own game. I came across the ever so important topic of 'Programming Languages' and <span class="highlight">C++</span> stood out to me. After a bit 
                    more digging I found an amazing set of free tutorials online and began the endevour. I spent countless hours programming and trying my own little projects with
                    what I had learned. I cannot tell you how many times I suddenly realized it was 3am on a school night!

                <h6 class="highlight">Adding Fuel To My Passion</h6>

                <p>
                    That was the start of one of if not my largest passion in life. Programming! At that point I was making
                    custom console based applications to help with my homework. But I wanted to learn more! So I began looking into various graphics libraries.
                    I dabbled in <span class="highlight">Allegro</span> before settling into learning <span class="highlight">SFML</span> I preferred the compatibility
                    and implementations of it. I began making clones of classic games like Pong, Brick Breaker, Astroids, etc before attempting a larger project and 
                    making a simple platformer with a couple of levels.

               <h6 class="highlight">The College Years</h6>
                <p>
                    Now if we fast forward to College I began a dual major in <span class="highlight">Software and Embedded Systems Engineering</span>, in what little
                    free time I had between working and school I still spent a lot of time practicing other languages and that is when my interest in 
                    <span class="highlight">Web Development</span> began. I started by learning the basic front end stuff such as: <span class="highlight">HTML, CSS, and JS</span>
                    This was great for making some basic sites for fun and to help organize myself. But I heard the call to backend and making the routes work rather than
                    just loading a different html file. To do this I chose to learn fullstack development. I first learned the <span class="highlight">MEAN stack</span>
                    today I am working on changing to the <span class="highlight">MERN stack</span> to adapt to the ever changing world of web development.
                    Along the way I have also dabbled in <span class="highlight">Java, Ruby, Python, C, C#, R, JSON, SQL, and MongoDB</span>

                    My favorite part of my journey's beginning was, and still is my passion for learning new technologies and expanding 
                    my knowledge of the ones I use all the time. I love getting the chance to work with new technologies and working with ones I know well.
                    In fact <span class="highlight"> this very site </span> is a form of practice using the following technologies:
